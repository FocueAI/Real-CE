## Benchmark Installation

This project is mainly built upon [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR). Please see `BASICSR_INSTALLATION.md` or the original repo for installation details. The recognition evaluation needs Chinese and English recognizer weights. They can be downloaded from the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wga0xFdBSkAt_Pif3wPMG4tnHA9wQ7wD/view?usp=sharing

After downloading the pth files, you need to place the files in `<ROOT>/basicsr/metrics/` for weights loading.
